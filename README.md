 PythonCaesarEncryptionDecryption

This Python script takes a string containing alphabetic characters and maps each letter to a new letter based on a predefined dictionary called mapping. The script iterates through the original string and replaces each letter with its corresponding mapped letter using the mapping dictionary. The resulting string is stored in a variable called result.

The mapping dictionary maps each letter of the alphabet to a different letter. For example, the letter "a" is mapped to "L", "b" is mapped to "M", and so on. The script checks if each letter in the original string is in the mapping dictionary, and if it is, replaces it with the corresponding mapped letter. If the letter is not in the mapping dictionary, it is added to the result variable unchanged.

After the string is mapped, the script prints the original message and the resulting string for comparison.
